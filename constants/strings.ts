  none_minimal:
    `A PHQ-9 score of 0 to 4 suggests minimal or no depressive symptoms. This is often an indicator of good emotional health. While you might experience occasional low moods, they generally do not significantly impact your daily life. It’s a good time to focus on maintaining your well-being through healthy habits like exercise, mindfulness, and strong social connections. Even with minimal symptoms, engaging in self-care practices is always beneficial.`,
  mild:
    `If your score falls between 5 and 9, it indicates mild depression. You might be noticing subtle changes in your mood, energy levels, or interest in activities. These signs, while not severe, are worth acknowledging. This range is an excellent opportunity to proactively engage in self-care strategies. Consider exploring stress reduction techniques, improving sleep hygiene, or increasing physical activity. It's also a good moment to reflect on what might be contributing to these feelings and decide if seeking some guidance could be helpful.`,
  moderate:
    `A PHQ-9 score of 10 to 14 suggests moderate depression. At this level, symptoms are more noticeable and might be affecting your daily functioning, relationships, or work. This is a point where considering professional guidance becomes particularly important. A mental health professional can offer tailored support, whether through therapy, lifestyle adjustments, or other interventions. Early intervention can make a significant difference, and many find relief and strategies for coping by speaking with someone.`,
  moderately_severe:
    `A score of 15 to 19 indicates moderately severe depression. Symptoms are likely prominent and significantly impacting various aspects of your life. You might find it challenging to engage in daily tasks, maintain your routine, or experience joy. It's crucial to seek professional help at this stage. Mental health professionals can provide comprehensive assessments and develop effective treatment plans to support you through these challenges. Reaching out for help is a brave and self-compassionate step. Take the first step and assess your emotional health today.`,
  severe:
    `A PHQ-9 score between 20 and 27 signifies <b>severe depression</b>. At this level, symptoms are intense and pervasive, severely affecting your ability to function. Immediate professional support is crucial. This might involve urgent consultation with a doctor, a psychiatrist, or another mental health specialist. In some cases, hospitalization may be necessary to ensure safety and provide intensive care. It's important to remember that severe depression is treatable, and help is available.`,

export const anxietyExplanations = {
  minimal_anxiety:
    "A score in this range suggests that you are experiencing minimal or no anxiety symptoms. This is generally considered a healthy range, indicating that you are managing daily stressors effectively and are not significantly bothered by generalized anxiety. While this score is reassuring, it doesn't mean you won't experience anxiety at all, as anxiety is a normal human emotion. It simply implies that your current level of anxiety isn't significantly impacting your life. Continue practicing healthy coping strategies and mindfulness to maintain your mental well-being.",
  mild_anxiety:
    "If your score falls between 5 and 9, you are likely experiencing mild anxiety. At this level, you might notice some anxiety symptoms, but they are generally manageable and may not severely disrupt your daily life. You might find yourself worrying more often than usual or feeling a bit more irritable or restless. This is an opportune moment for self-awareness and implementing simple anxiety management techniques. Consider exploring relaxation exercises, mindfulness, or discussing your feelings with a trusted friend or family member. Recognizing mild anxiety early can prevent it from escalating.",
  moderate_anxiety:
    "A score of 10 to 14 indicates moderate anxiety. At this stage, your anxiety symptoms are more noticeable and might be having a noticeable impact on your daily functioning, work, relationships, or overall quality of life. You might find it harder to control your worries, experience more physical symptoms like restlessness or trouble sleeping, and feel frequently on edge. This range suggests it could be beneficial to explore support options. Consider speaking with a doctor or a mental health professional who can offer guidance and discuss potential coping strategies. Proactive steps at this level can significantly improve your well-being.",
  severe_anxiety:
    "A score between 15 and 21 suggests severe anxiety. This level indicates that anxiety symptoms are highly prominent and likely causing significant distress and impairment in various aspects of your life. You might find it extremely difficult to control worrying, experience persistent physical symptoms, and feel overwhelmed by your anxiety. If your score is in this range, it is strongly recommended that you seek professional help immediately. Mental health professionals can provide comprehensive assessments and develop an appropriate treatment plan to help you manage and alleviate your symptoms. Remember, seeking help is a courageous act, and support is readily available.",
